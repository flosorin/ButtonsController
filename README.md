# FourMatrix

Arduino library to control five buttons using only one analog pin (and ground). 

The purpose is to place the buttons in a cross to have the controls LEFT / RIGHT / UP / DOWN and CENTER.

For this to work, you will need five 10K resistors in addition to the five buttons (see schematic enclosed).

The example included displays the pressed button as string on the serial line.
